# Changelog

## 0.6.0 — new look

- Light theme only, with one palette: Safaricom's green and neutrals plus the red and dark green of
  the Daraja Studio logo. A test refuses any other colour in the source.
- Components follow GitHub's Primer design: one-pixel borders, six-pixel corners, bordered cards
  with a muted header, pill labels, and banners with a leading icon.
- Menu grouped into Money and Manage, with the seven unbuilt items folded under Coming soon.
- Home opens with the three most-used actions as tiles.
- Guided setup shows "Step N of M", counts only the steps your answers need, and ends every step
  with the same Back and Next buttons.
- Animated line icons (line-md), bundled with the app.
- Logo and icons exported at the sizes they are shown at; square favicons and a home-screen icon.

## 0.5.0 — first public release

Self-hosted, single-organisation M-Pesa console. One install = one organisation = one shortcode.

- Guided first-run setup: what the business needs (pay out, take money in, or both), the Daraja
  app, the shortcode, the public address, and — only when the business takes money in — a passkey
  proved by a real Safaricom acknowledgement before the wizard will call it ready.
- Send money to a phone, with balance checks, duplicate protection and a five-attempt status sweep
  for anything Safaricom never answered.
- Ask a customer to pay (STK Push), with the result and receipt in History.
- Reverse a payment, guarded by the receipt of a settlement that can still be taken back.
- QR codes for a counter or a rider.
- Look up a payment by receipt, People with role-based permissions, and Settings for every
  Daraja credential, mirroring what the Safaricom organisation portal itself would show.
- Everything the Daraja API cannot do, listed honestly rather than left unexplained.
